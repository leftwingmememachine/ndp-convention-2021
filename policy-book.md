# INNOVATING AND PROSPERING IN A NEW ENERGY ECONOMY 

The current economic crisis reveals just how vital social democratic
policies are in today's globalized economy.

After years of under-funding and de-regulation, governments across
Canada and around the world are quickly embracing social democratic
initiatives to off-set the harmful effects that the economic downturn is
having on the middle class and the vulnerable.

New Democrats believe in the intelligent and prudent use of government,
not just to respond to economic crises, but to play a leadership role in
setting a path for future prosperity.

New Democrats believe that economic prosperity for all citizens can be
achieved through proper regulation, strategic investments in both
physical and social infrastructure and a long-term sustain- able
economic growth strategy.

New Democrats believe in a comprehensive effort to safeguard the jobs of
today and create the jobs of tomorrow by using the fiscal, legal and
trade opportunities at Canada's disposal. Education, skills training and
research are the cornerstones to prosperity and innovation in a new
energy economy.

Expanding economic freedom and opportunity is achieved, not through
large corporations con- centrating power and capital, but through
thriving small businesses, local community development, and cooperative
enterprises, reinforcing strong sectors in our natural resource sectors
as well as manufacturing.

Around the world, social democratic governments have successfully shown
that the goals of equality and economic well-being are not in conflict
rather they depend on each other. A New Democrat government will pursue
these goals and build a green and prosperous Canada where no one is left behind.

# BUILDING A CLEAN AND SUSTAINABLE CANADA

A living biosphere and a sustainable environment for future generations
are public necessities that require collective action.

Tackling climate change requires incentives for individuals, tough
benchmarks for industry and leadership from the federal government.

Future generations are counting on action today. Canadians cannot afford
to let economic and financial crises become reasons for inaction on
global warming, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental
imperatives.

New Democrats reject the claim of a fundamental contradiction between
environmental health and economic growth. Developing green energy
industries is an opportunity for a dynamic new era of job creation,
building a competitive advantage for Canada in environmental
technologies and practices, which in turn help foster innovations in
manufacturing.

Reshaping energy policy for the 21st century means moving away from
fossil-fuel dependence toward a green energy future by investing in
solar, wind, wave, and geothermal sources, working with provinces and
territories to share clean energy; and ensuring energy conservation in
transporta- tion and building methods.

A New Democrat government will make Canada an environmental leader on
the world stage

by honouring treaty obligations, incorporating strong environmental
standards in trade agreements and ensuring Canadian companies operating
abroad will be held to standards and practices that reduce their
footprint and leave local ecosystems in good health.

# SECTION 3

# INVESTING IN A CANADA WHERE NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND

New Democrats strive to build a society in which every one of its
members can reach their full potential. Such progress is judged by how
society cares for and supports one another. That means protecting the
vulnerable and ensuring that every citizen has access to high quality
social programs.

That also means working to keep our communi- ties secure, to ensure our
children grow up in a world of mutual respect and safe neighbourhoods.
It means taking effective measures when crimes are committed and
violence threatens our quality of life.

# REDEFINING CANADA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD

One of the defining features of social democracy is solidarity with
people around the globe -- partic- ularly with the poor and powerless,
those facing persecution, and the victims of acts of genocide. New
Democrats believe that support for human rights is the central value of
an independent foreign policy.

New Democrats believe that Canada has an obligation to share its wealth
with the world's most poor and vulnerable; that we must become a leader
for food security, women's equality, ensuring environmental
sustainability, and ending the AIDS pandemic. Fighting for fair trade
includes enforceable standards on human and environmental rights in all
agreements, and in all international trade bodies. Canadian companies
operating overseas must also safeguard the rights of workers and local
communities.

New Democrats believe that defence policy should focus on Canada's
rights as a sovereign and effective world citizen -- including defending
the Arctic and our territorial waters for the benefit of all citizens
and future generations. Peace building will be the top military priority
of a New Democrat government.

For social democrats, the aspiration to equality among peoples knows no
borders.

answer the call with global leadership.

# SECTION 5

# GOVERNING IN AN INCLUSIVE AND FAIR CANADA

Democracy in Canada is in urgent need of repair.

New Democrats believe it's vital that trust and confidence in our
practices and institutions be restored.

That means making sure Canada's electoral system truly represents the
expressions of voters, ensuring Parliament reflects real party support
across Canada. It means cleaning up the appoint- ments process,
abolishing the unelected and unnecessary Senate, and eliminating
obstacles to the right to cast a ballot. Making Parliament more
accountable also means policing lobbyists and protecting public servants
who report unethical practices.

New Democrats are committed to the kind of mutual respect among levels
of government that is the hallmark of cooperative federalism; that makes
collaboration on social and economic policies work, and that ensures the
universality of social programs. Respect for each government's specific
areas of jurisdiction is vital to ensuring

a healthy democracy. For New Democrats, cooperative federalism is also
asymmetrical federalism; recognizing and encouraging Quebec's unique
national character in North America, with French as the language of
daily life and work. Our federalism supports Quebec's right to its own
progressive economic and social practices, and to the development of its
own sense of nationhood.

New Democrats believe in working with Canada's First Nations, Inuit, and
Métis peoples to move toward self-government in practical, concrete
steps, supporting the settlement of land claims, and backing up these
actions

with investment in the urgent social needs of Indigenous communities.

There are many ways of being a Canadian. By strengthening political
democracy and strength- ening Canadian federalism, a New Democrat
government will strengthen the bonds that pull our diverse populace and
unique communities

together into one truly democratic federation, a model that would serve
as an inspiration and a worthy example around the globe.

## 5.5

a.  Recognizing the national character of Quebec, based in particular on
    a society with French as the language of work and the common language of
    the public domain; a unique culture expressed through a sense of
    identity and belonging to Quebec; a specific history; and political, 
    economic, cultural and social institutions of its own.

b.  Affirming asymmetrical federalism, recognizing Quebec's need for
    appropriate tools to meet its unique challenges.

c.  Recognizing that Quebec can withdraw, with compensation, from
    federal programs that fall within its jurisdiction.

d.  Supporting Quebec's role in promoting the French culture in North
    America, while respecting the right of linguistic minorities within

d.  Working with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples to implement
    self-government.

e.  Establishing new procedures for land claims that respect Indigenous
    title and that are independent, efficient, just and equitable.

f.  Protecting and promoting the diverse languages and cultures of First
    Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples.

g.  Ensuring equitable participation of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
    peoples and governments in Canada's stewardship of the environment
    and resources, and on appropriate boards, commissions and
    international delegations.

## 5.8

# SECTION 6

# STRENGTHENING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE CANADIAN IDENTITY

New Democrats are proud of their tradition of upholding the rights of
all peoples, especially minorities and disadvantaged groups.

The equality social democrats seek is a precon- dition for the social
participation of all citizens. That's why New Democrats support both the
letter and the spirit of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, recognizing
that human dignity requires not just individual civil rights, but
economic, social and cultural rights as well. A New Democrat government
will strengthen the human rights of Canadian citizens.

New Democrats also believe in the ongoing need to strengthen the
Canadian identity. Arts and culture enrich individual lives and
community identities. It helps tell the stories that place us in our
country and in our world. Public support for artists and culture workers
ensure that the story of Canada gets told, at home and around the world.

Theatre, film, dance, music, literature, and

the visual arts make an immense, often under- appreciated contribution
to our economy and employment. That's why social democrats are committed
to supporting and empowering artists and culture workers. And the work
they produce improves the quality of life for all of us who

seek the nourishment that culture and the arts can provide.

Public broadcasting has been as important for opening Canada up as
public rail and air transport. The Canadian Broadcasting Corpo-

ration must be protected and its administration made more transparent.
Foreign ownership and uncompetitive media concentration has

squeezed out regional dailies and radio stations. New Democrats will
ensure local community broadcasters, and alternative media, are given
the encouragement they need. That also means the immense creative and
educational possibilities

of the Internet must remain freely available to all Canadians.

## 6.1

a.  Promoting women's economic equality by ensuring pay equity,
    encouraging unionization, improving access to EI, and setting a

    develop better work-family balance.

    personnel and patients at abortion clinics.

    obligations.

    women's equality in Canada.

    serving in Canada' military or RCMP whether they served during war,
    here at home, or on peacekeeping missions and that measures are in
    place to continually safeguard equality of all serving members.

    to advise the Government of Canada on, and promote women's equality
    rights.

    menstrual products and contraception.

## 6.2

### Children's Rights

New Democrats believe in:

a.  Upholding the rights of children set out in the UN Convention and in
    particular the right to life, development, and non-discrimination,
    and respecting the priority accorded to the child's best interest,
    and to children's right to be heard in all matters affecting them;
    and ensuring such rights are upheld consistently and uniformly
    across Canada and, eventually, expressly incorporated into Canadian
    law.

b.  Instituting a National Children's Advocate, appointed by Parliament,
    to promote and protect the rights of children under federal
    jurisdiction including Indigenous children, immigrant and refugee
    children, and children in the youth criminal justice system, to work
    alongside children and youth advocates of the various provinces and
    territories.

c.  Restoring and further developing a system for gathering and
    compiling specific information on child welfare so the government
    can effectively and comprehensively evaluate children's situations
    and any shortfalls in upholding children's rights.

d.  Having the government of Canada immediately produce, as part of its
    work with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and in
    collaboration with the provinces and territories as well as concerned
    non-profit organizations representing civil society and children,
    detailed and transparent reports on the status of children's rights
    in Canada, and share the Committee's findings and recommendations with
    Parliament and with the Canadian public with a view to better meeting
    its obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, all
    to better honour Canada's obligations under the UN Convention.

f.  The Rights of the Child as expressed in the UN Convention on the
    Rights of the Child ratified by Canada December 13, 1991.

    and same-sex marriage.

    LGBTQI2S+ persons, particularly against the criminalization of
    homosexual relationships between consenting adults.

    orientation or identity.

g.  Stopping discriminatory practices against LGBTQI2S+ persons in
