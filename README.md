# NDP Policy Book and Constitution

I used a variety of automated tools to extract the text of the NDP constitution and policy book into a more accessible format that includes a clickable table of contents.

Because my tools and eyes aren't perfect, its possible there may be errors. Sections may be mislabeled, and there may be typos. I tried my best to correct those errors by hamd but I can't guarantee this is correct.
