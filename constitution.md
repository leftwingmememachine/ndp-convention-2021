# CONSTITUTION OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF CANADA

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 2018

# PREAMBLE

Canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. New
Democrats are Canadians who believe we can be a better one --- a
country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. We can build
sustainable prosperity and a society that shares its benefits more
fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for
our children. We can do our part to save the world's environment. New
Democrats work together to these ends for the sake of our fellow
citizens and in the interests of all of humanity.

New Democrats are proud of our political and activist heritage, and
our long record of visionary, practical, and successful governments.
That heritage and that record have distinguished and inspired our
party since the creation of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation
in 1933 and the founding of the New Democratic Party in 1961.

New Democrats seek a future that brings together the best of the
insights and objectives of Canadians who, within the social democratic
and democratic socialist traditions, have worked through farmer,
labour, co-operative, feminist, human rights and environmental
movements, and with First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit peoples, to build a
more just, equal, and sustainable Canada within a global community
dedicated to the same goals.

New Democrats celebrate Canada's diversity and the deep histories,
traditions and aspirations of all of its peoples. New Democrats
believe in an intercultural integration model based on solidarity and harmonious
exchanges among individuals of differing cultures.

New Democrats believe in freedom and democracy and in a positive role
for democratically elected and accountable Parliaments, legislatures,
and the governments responsible to them.

New Democrats affirm a role for government in helping to create the
conditions for sustainable prosperity. We believe in a rules-based
economy, nationally and globally, in which governments have the power
to address the limitations of the market in addressing the common good
by having the power to act in the public interest for social and
economic justice, and for the integrity of the environment.

New Democrats belong to the family of other progressive democratic
political parties that govern successfully in many countries around
the world. In co-operation with like minded political parties and
governments, New Democrats are committed to working together for
peace, international co-operation, and the common good of all -- the
common good being our fundamental purpose as a movement and as a party.

# APPENDIX - RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR PLENARY SESSIONS 

(See Article V, Section 4)

1.  The President or one of the Vice Presidents shall take the Chair at
    the time specified, at all regular or special Conventions. The
    President or one of the Vice Presidents, or a Convention
    Chairperson or Chairpersons chosen by the Convention, shall occupy
    the Chair and preside over the plenary sessions of a Convention.

2.  A delegate wishing to speak shall proceed to one of the microphones
    provided for that purpose When recognized by the chairperson the delegate
    shall give his/her name and the constituency or organization represented and
    shall confine any remarks to the question at issue.

3.  Speeches shall be limited to three minutes. This shall not apply to
    the spokesperson for a committee when introducing a report on
    behalf of the committee.

4.  A delegate shall not speak more than once upon a motion, except that
    the spokesperson for a committee who introduced a report may also
    close the debate.

5.  A delegate shall not interrupt another except if it be to call to a
    point of order.

6.  A delegate called to order shall yield the ï¬oor until the question
    of order has been decided.

7.  Two delegates may appeal the decision of the Chair, one of whom may
    state the reasons for the appeal. When thus challenged, the Chairperson must
    vacate the Chair until the appeal is resolved. The question shall not be
    debatable except that the Chairperson may make an explanation of the
    decision. The acting Chairperson shall put the question thus: "Shall
    the decision of the Chair be sustained?"

8.  Questions shall be decided by a show of hands or by a standing vote.
    A standing vote shall be counted upon a request from the ï¬oor when
    there is an apparent closeness in the vote

9.  The Chairperson shall not vote on any question, except in the case
    of a tie. In that event the Chairperson shall cast the deciding
    vote.

10. When "the previous question" is moved, no discussion or amendment of
    either motion is permitted. If a majority of voting delegates vote
    that "the question be now put," it shall be put without debate.
    If the motion to put the question is defeated, discussion will
    continue. If in the view of the Chairperson sufficient debate has taken
    place, a motion for "the previous question" made directly from the
    ï¬oor, may be accepted at the discretion of the Chairperson, whether or
    not the mover thereof has proceeded to one of the microphones as
    provided in Rule 2.

11. Reports from panels shall not be amended directly from the ï¬oor.
    Panels shall report resolutions to plenary in numerical order in
    the following order of categories: those passed
    by panel, those tabled by panel, those defeated in panel, and those
    without a mover in panel. A delegate may, however move a motion
    to refer a resolution to the Resolutions Committee, with instructions,
    and if this is supported by a majority vote, the Resolutions Committee
    will consider the instructions. Following such consideration, the
    Resolutions Committee will bring back the resolutions to plenary with
    their recommendation.

12. Reports of committees shall not be amended directly on the ï¬oor, but
    it shall be in order to refer a committee's report, or any section thereof,
    back to the committee for reconsideration in the light of the discussion on
    the ï¬oor, or for consideration of a particular point raised in the
    motion to refer. A motion to refer is not debatable unless it raises a
    particular point, in which case debate shall be confined to such point.

13. A delegate shall not move a motion to refer back after having spoken
    on the question at issue.

14. A motion may be reconsidered provided the mover of the motion to
    reconsider voted with the majority, and notice of motion is given
    for consideration at the next plenary session, and said motion to
    reconsider is supported by two-thirds of the delegates present and
    voting.

15. The hours of a Convention shall be established at the first plenary
    session of the Convention. These hours may be changed during a
    Convention only under the provision of Rule 17.

16. In all matters not regulated herein, Roberts' Rules of Order shall
    apply.

17. Any of the above rules may be suspended by unanimous consent or may
    be changed for the Convention at which such change is made, by a
    majority vote, on a motion of which one day's notice has been
    given.

18. The unfinished business of the Convention shall be referred to the
    Council.

#  RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR PANEL OR COMMITTEE SESSIONS
